# Variables and Workspace

## TL;DR

In R we will create things (e.g. tables of data, text "strings", functions, etc.) and name those things. These variables and their associated data will float around our workspace. 

A workspace is sort of like a physical workbench: we'll have tools and materials available.
We can see what's with the `ls` command.

Because it's easier to create things than it is to see what we've got laying around our workspace.

## Intro

```R
> msg <- "hello world"
> print(msg)
[1] "hello world"
> root2 <- sqrt(1 + 1)
```
